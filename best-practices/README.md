## 📁 Files Overview

### 1. **`01-interpolation-best-practices.component.ts`**
- **Interpolation Best Practices** - When and how to use `{{ }}` correctly
- Shows good vs. bad examples with explanations
- Interactive demo with live updates
- Demonstrates what NOT to do with interpolation

### 2. **`02-property-binding-best-practices.component.ts`**
- **Property Binding Best Practices** - When and how to use `[property]` correctly
- Shows proper usage of HTML attributes, CSS classes, and styles
- Interactive demo with dynamic theming and sizing

### 3. **`best-practices.component.ts`**
- **Main component** that brings all best practices together
- Navigation between different binding types
- Key principles and additional resources
- Placeholder sections for future best practices

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Import into your app**
```typescript
// In your app.routes.ts
import { BestPracticesComponent } from './best-practices/best-practices.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'best-practices', component: BestPracticesComponent }
];
```

### 2. **Or use individual components**
```typescript
// Import specific best practices
import { InterpolationBestPracticesComponent } from './best-practices/01-interpolation-best-practices.component';
import { PropertyBindingBestPracticesComponent } from './best-practices/02-property-binding-best-practices.component';
```

### 3. **Add to your template**
```html
<!-- Use the main component -->
<app-best-practices></app-best-practices>

<!-- Or use individual best practices -->
<app-interpolation-best-practices></app-interpolation-best-practices>
<app-property-binding-best-practices></app-property-binding-best-practices>
```

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### **Interpolation Best Practices**
- ✅ **DO use interpolation for:** Text display, method calls, simple calculations
- ❌ **DON'T use interpolation for:** HTML attributes, CSS properties, boolean attributes
- 🎯 **Rule:** Interpolation is for TEXT content only

### **Property Binding Best Practices**
- ✅ **DO use property binding for:** HTML attributes, CSS classes, form properties
- ❌ **DON'T use property binding for:** Text content, complex logic in templates
- 🎯 **Rule:** Keep templates clean by moving logic to component methods

### **General Principles**
1. **Use the Right Tool** - Each binding type has a specific purpose
2. **Keep Templates Clean** - Move complex logic to component methods
3. **Performance Matters** - Avoid creating new objects in templates
4. **Follow Angular Patterns** - Use built-in features as intended

## 🎨 Features

- **Interactive Examples**: See good vs. bad practices in action
- **Live Feedback**: All examples show real-time updates
- **Code Examples**: Syntax highlighting with explanations
- **Performance Tips**: Learn what to avoid for better performance
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Start with Interpolation** - Learn what interpolation is meant for
2. **Move to Property Binding** - Learn proper attribute and style binding
3. **Understand the Rules** - Learn when to use each binding type
4. **Practice Good Habits** - Apply these principles to your own code

## 🔧 Requirements

## 🎯 Best Practices Checklist

### **Before Writing Code**
- [ ] Determine if you need text display or attribute setting
- [ ] Choose the appropriate binding type
- [ ] Plan component methods for complex logic

### **While Writing Code**
- [ ] Use interpolation `{{ }}` only for text
- [ ] Use property binding `[property]` for attributes
- [ ] Keep templates clean and readable
- [ ] Move complex logic to component methods

### **After Writing Code**
- [ ] Review for performance implications
- [ ] Ensure templates are maintainable
- [ ] Check for proper binding usage
- [ ] Test with different data scenarios
